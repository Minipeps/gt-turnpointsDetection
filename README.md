# Turnpoints Detection Visualization
This p5.js sketch was developped to visualize and compare different turnpoints detection algorithms for glide flights analysis and scoring. Check the [XContest website](https://www.xcontest.org) to see some flight examples. 

Created using [p5-manager](https://github.com/chiunhau/p5-manager), see also the p5js [website](https://p5js.org/) and [Github repository](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/) for more information.
